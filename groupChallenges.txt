challenges in final project:
-learning to use github
-chosing a form of communication
-keeping track of all changes
-only one person can push/ make changes at one time

challenges faced in putting together the application:
-getting github to work properly (usu. an issue with the git.lock file)
-issues when one person was making changes at the same time and our changes couldn't be shared
-mostly it was github
-when search bar is used, login flashes
-
